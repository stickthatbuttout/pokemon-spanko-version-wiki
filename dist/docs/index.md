Welcome to the wiki for the fan game Pok√©mon Spanko Version. As the title implies, this is a fetish game, so consider this fair warning as to the content.

### Inaccuracies

Although I will try to update everything to be as accurate as possible, there is a LOT of data involved and some information may be outdated or incorrect. Check for supplemental documentation in the game folder.

A common inaccuracy type is likely to be movesets. Development on this started before the release of Gen 8, so movesets for some pokemon may be outdated.

### Minor Trainer Battles

For a lot of the more minor trainers in the game, I didn't specify movesets for their pokemon, so these moves will show up blank on the wiki. However, their pokemon know whichever moves they would naturally learn by leveling up. Likewise, if an ability isn't specified, it will be a random selection between their two non-hidden abilities available for that species.
